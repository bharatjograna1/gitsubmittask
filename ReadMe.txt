front-end features
	1. List
	2. Edit
	3. react hook implemented
	4. Delete
	5. Css-style-hover
	6. redux-saga store implemented
	7. Add
		to add and delete we can use same model
	
i'm also trying to develop back-end Node API but my laptop not supporting as already i told you that.
	for that we need 4 table
		1. user_list
			table to match login data of user
			
		2. profile_list
			table to save profile detail pic, context, name
			
		3. catogary_list
			table to save catogary
			
		3. like_dislike_list
			table to save like n dislike with profile and name of user
			
		we can do this with mongoDB also but in this project Mysql is perfect.
			
i made some changes as per our requirement but my laptop shut down so i can't continue 
	solwininfo\nodeAPI
		
screenshots are added to 
	solwininfo\screen shot
	
i haven't done all the thing i just done that much from which you can see my skills n if that is a part of project that it need some changes like back-end and because of back-end support we can manage easier than this local storage.
